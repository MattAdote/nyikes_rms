            Dear {{
                member.last_name + " " + member.first_name +  (" " + member.middle_name if member.middle_name else "")
            }},
            </p>
            <p>
                Your account has been successfully activated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your can now log in to the Nyikes RMS application using the following credentials:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>email:</b> {{ member.email }} <em>OR</em> <b>username:</b> {{ member.username }}</li>                
                    <li><b>password:</b> The password you set on the activation form</li>
                </ul>                
                <br/><br/>
                In case you forget your password, you can easily reset it through the Nyikes RMS application.
                <br/><br/>
                In the unlikely event that you have difficulty doing so or just want to say hello, kindly
                get in touch with the Nyikes IT department through whatsapp, call or sms.
                <br/><br/>
